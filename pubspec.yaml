  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/fonts/inter/
    - assets/fonts/general_sans/
    - assets/fonts/Poppins/

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GeneralSans
      fonts:
