  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/fonts/inter/
    - assets/fonts/general_sans/
    - assets/db/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GeneralSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/general_sans/GeneralSans-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/general_sans/GeneralSans-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/general_sans/GeneralSans-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/general_sans/GeneralSans-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/general_sans/GeneralSans-Light.otf
          weight: 300

    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter_28pt-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter_28pt-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/inter/Inter_28pt-SemiBold.ttf
